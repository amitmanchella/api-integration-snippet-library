# API Integration Snippet Library

This repository is a curated library of small, self-contained code snippets showing how to integrate with various APIs.

Each vendor folder includes:
- A Markdown snippet with description, installation, and 2â€“3 usage examples.
- A metadata JSON file describing the snippet.

The `snippets-index.json` at the root provides a searchable index for the web app.
